You are a top-tier AI coding assistant. Your task is to generate a **complete, fully optimized multi-agent sports scraper project** with async agents, context managers, storage modules, and checkpointing. The project is designed for **Oracle Always Free** hosting and must include **all the following agents**:

1. Popup Agent – activates only on page reload and popup appearance.
2. League Agent – manages multiple leagues concurrently and coordinates their agents.
3. Timer Agent – monitors pre-match timers, marking matches as LIVE or PENDING.
4. Matchday Agent – collects all match data, including dropdown markets; starts next matchday odds when current matchday goes live; enforces pre-match odds cutoff (no retries when timer ≤ 10s).
5. Live Matchday Agent – monitors live matches, collects goals and scoring times; confirms data using results tab.
6. Results Agent – collects finalized match data from the results tab after matches end.
7. Standings Agent – updates league standings after 5 matches, storing checkpointed data.

### Project Requirements & Optimizations

**Architecture & Execution:**
- Fully async agents with independent retry sequences.
- Agents operate **per league** without interfering with others.
- PRE → LIVE → RESULT → STANDINGS state transitions.
- Task queues and scheduler managed by a central **Planner module**.
- Agents resume from last known state after failure or crash.

**Browser & Stealth Optimizations:**
- Single headless browser instance with **separate contexts per league**.
- Asset blocking: images, CSS, fonts, unnecessary scripts.
- Lazy loading for dropdown markets.
- Tab reuse and minimized browser launches.
- Stealth mode to reduce bot detection.

**Data Storage & Checkpointing:**
- JSON-based structured storage for matches, live data, results, and standings.
- Optional Oracle Free DB integration for structured queries.
- Batch writes to minimize I/O.
- Deduplication to prevent repeated collection.
- Periodic checkpointing to resume after crashes.

**Failure Recovery:**
- Independent retries per agent.
- Automatic resume from last checkpoint.
- Error logging with timestamps, match IDs, and agent names.
- Optional notification hooks.

**Performance:**
- Low CPU/memory usage for Oracle Always Free.
- Rate limiting to avoid server bans.
- Efficient async scheduling for multiple leagues.

### Deliverables:
1. **Planner Module** – schedules tasks PRE → LIVE → RESULT per league with retry policies, queues, and checkpointing.
2. **Executor Module** – launches all agents asynchronously, manages browser contexts, coordinates agent messaging, and writes data to storage.
3. **Agent Skeletons** – fully modular async classes for each agent with placeholders for logic, retries, and checkpoints.
4. **Storage Module** – handles JSON/Oracle Free DB reads/writes with batching and deduplication.
5. **Context Managers** – manages browser lifecycle and league-specific contexts.
6. **Logging Module** – tracks agent activity, retries, and failures.

### Output Requirements:
- Fully executable Python code scaffolding (async/await).
- Modular code with clear comments for each component.
- Ready-to-run on Oracle Always Free.
- Optimized for speed, stealth, reliability, and minimal resource usage.
- Include explicit inter-agent messaging contracts.
- Include PRE → LIVE → RESULT → STANDINGS state diagram in code comments or documentation.
- Include detailed examples of how to add a new league and new agent.
