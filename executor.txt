You are a highly skilled AI coding assistant. Your task is to generate an **Executor module** for a multi-agent sports scraper system designed by the Planner.

The Executor should:
1. Launch all agents asynchronously for each league:
   - Popup Agent
   - Timer Agent
   - Matchday Agent
   - Live Matchday Agent
   - Results Agent
   - Standings Agent
2. Ensure **independent retry logic** for each agent without blocking others.
3. Manage a **single headless browser instance** with separate **contexts per league**.
4. Implement **DOM mutation observers** or polling to detect:
   - Pre-match timer changes
   - Match start
   - Goals and results
5. Collect data into **JSON files or Oracle Free DB** with checkpointing.
6. Include **failure recovery and resume logic**:
   - Resume agents from last PRE → LIVE → RESULT state
   - Retry failed tasks independently
   - Log errors and skipped matches
7. Optimize for **Oracle Always Free**:
   - Low CPU/memory usage
   - Block unnecessary assets
   - Reuse browser tabs
   - Rate limit requests to avoid detection
8. Include detailed comments and modular code placeholders for:
   - Each agent’s internal logic
   - Messaging between agents
   - Data storage
   - Planner integration

Output should be a fully executable **scaffolding** with async agent runners, context managers, and storage modules, ready to integrate with the Planner.
