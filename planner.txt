You are a highly skilled AI coding assistant. Your task is to generate a detailed **Planner module** for a multi-agent sports scraper. The project is optimized for **Oracle Always Free**, **async concurrency**, **headless browser context isolation**, and **JSON/Oracle Free DB storage**.

The Planner should:
1. Schedule tasks for each league, including:
   - Pre-match data collection (PRE)
   - Live match monitoring (LIVE)
   - Results verification (RESULT)
   - Standings updates
2. Assign each agent its own **task queue** and **retry sequence**.
3. Respect pre-match deadlines (stop retries when timer ≤ 10s).
4. Use async scheduling for concurrent execution of multiple leagues.
5. Support checkpointing for crash recovery.
6. Optimize for **speed, stealth, and low resource usage**:
   - Minimize CPU/memory footprint
   - Block unnecessary browser assets
   - Use lazy loading of dropdown markets
   - Reuse browser tabs and contexts
7. Generate a structured plan output that includes:
   - League ID
   - Agent type (Timer, Matchday, Live, Results, Standings)
   - Task schedule
   - Retry policy
   - Checkpointing info
8. Include Python or Node.js code scaffolding with async tasks, placeholders for agent logic, and comments explaining each step.

Output should be ready-to-run and fully modular so that each league can operate independently.
